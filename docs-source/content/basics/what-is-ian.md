**Ian is a simple tool to manage your development environment and your coding projects.**


## The idea behind Ian

Us, developers, love to work with the terminal. More reliable and simpler than most GUIs, this "black screen" allows also automation through scripting and blazing fast manipulation.

But even with these capabilities, we still execute pretty repetitive tasks and have troubles to make our local environment portable.
Sometimes, we're looking in our history to retrieve a database URI, change from one project directory to another one just to execute a command, and so on.

Ian was designed and created to solve these problems.


## How does ian tackle this problem ?

ian propose your to store and persist your projects and env configuration in order to interact with them more easily.
You can (among others things):

- List the packages installed on your environment and have them installed anytime you run ian on another device.
- Register commands per projects and give them an alias
- Update/upgrade your environment with a unified interface


## Every developer is unique

... Which bring us to customization and social interactions (yes, for those who still doubt about it, we are human too) !


### Maximum customization

We decided to offer the maximum customization possible to make you able to interact with your environment the way you like it.
In brief, we give you a set of default commands that we find useful in general and we let you add any subcommands you'd like to execute.

### The notion of project context

Projects depend on a huge number of factors: languages, platforms, frameworks, host ressources, etc
With ian, through an interactive setup you can provide the infos necessary to specific the context of execution of all the project commmands.

### Share your configuration

Using ian share, you can share your ian configuration files



In the next page, we'll go though the setup together :)

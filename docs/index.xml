&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ian is a simple tool to manage your development environment and your coding projects.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-idea-behind-ian&#34;&gt;The idea behind Ian&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Us, developers, love to work with the terminal. More reliable and simpler than most GUIs, this &amp;ldquo;black screen&amp;rdquo; allows also automation through scripting and blazing fast manipulation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But even with these capabilities, we still execute pretty repetitive tasks and have troubles to make our local environment portable.
Sometimes, we&amp;rsquo;re looking in our history to retrieve a database URI, change from one project directory to another one just to execute a command, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ian was designed and created to solve these problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-does-ian-tackle-this-problem&#34;&gt;How does ian tackle this problem ?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ian propose your to store and persist your projects and env configuration in order to interact with them more easily.
You can (among others things):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;List the packages installed on your environment and have them installed anytime you run ian on another device.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Register commands per projects and give them an alias&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Update/upgrade your environment with a unified interface&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;every-developer-is-unique&#34;&gt;Every developer is unique&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip; Which bring us to customization and social interactions (yes, for those who still doubt about it, we are human too) !&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;maximum-customization&#34;&gt;Maximum customization&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We decided to offer the maximum customization possible to make you able to interact with your environment the way you like it.
In brief, we give you a set of default commands that we find useful in general and we let you add any subcommands you&amp;rsquo;d like to execute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-notion-of-project-context&#34;&gt;The notion of project context&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Projects depend on a huge number of factors: languages, platforms, frameworks, host ressources, etc
With ian, through an interactive setup you can provide the infos necessary to specific the context of execution of all the project commmands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;share-your-configuration&#34;&gt;Share your configuration&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using ian share, you can share your ian configuration files&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the next page, we&amp;rsquo;ll go though the setup together :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;installation&#34;&gt;Installation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Installing ian is pretty straightforward.
All you have to do is to paste this in your terminal:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;# Bash/Zsh
python -c &amp;quot;$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thylong/ian/master/install/install.py)&amp;quot;

# Fish
python -c &amp;quot;(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thylong/ian/master/install/install.py)&amp;quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

      <title>Configuration</title>
      <link>https://goian.io/basics/configuration/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Ian relies a lot on configuration files as they describe your environment and your projects.
It&amp;rsquo;s possible to edit your entire configuration using ian commands (recommended) but if you&amp;rsquo;re stuck
or if you simply prefer to edit manually your configuration, it&amp;rsquo;s possible !&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ian configuration files are written with Yaml and are relatively simple to read.
If you don&amp;rsquo;t have specific ian files, no worries some are going to be generated
for you when you execute it for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;configuration-through-cli&#34;&gt;Configuration through CLI&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;config&#34;&gt;Config&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;config.yml contains all the settings that are not specific to a project or one of Ian&amp;rsquo;s feature.
This file is generated at the first run of Ian and can be edited at any time using Ian setup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It contains currently 2 variables like in this example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;dotfiles_repository&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;thylong/dotfiles&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;repositories_path&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;/Users/thylong/www/repositories&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;dotfiles_repository&lt;/strong&gt; is the path to your dotfiles repository.
This variable is used to manage your dotfiles configuration (learn more about it here: &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/webpro/awesome-dotfiles&#34;&gt;https://github.com/webpro/awesome-dotfiles&lt;/a&gt;).
if you don&amp;rsquo;t have one, you will not be able to use &lt;code&gt;ian env save&lt;/code&gt; feature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;notices info&#34; &gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, only Github is supported but stories to add support for Gitlab and Bitbucket are already in the pipe.
If you wish to support any new repositories solution, don&amp;rsquo;t hesitate to open an issue and/or make a pull request.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;repositories_path&lt;/strong&gt; is the fullpath to the directory that contains all your repositories.
This variable is use by a lot of Ian&amp;rsquo;s commands to interact with your projects reposories,
by env commands to display stats, by the setup, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;notices info&#34; &gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, we support only having a single repositories path but as many languages have their specificities, I&amp;rsquo;m thinking about an easy way to have a more granular configuration if needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h3 id=&#34;env&#34;&gt;Env&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;env.yml contains all the packages to be installed when setting up Ian on a new device.
This file is your best garantee to don&amp;rsquo;t loose your configuration during a migration and
to keep it consistent when working on several computers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The file content looks like the following example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-yaml&#34;&gt;    brew:
        - httpie
        - mongodb

    cask:
        - atom
        - caffeine
        - dash
        - google-chrome
        - iterm2
        - libreoffice
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;notices note&#34; &gt;&lt;p&gt;This file can contains packages that are not compatible with the current OS
you&amp;rsquo;re working on, during setup Ian will simply ignore them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h3 id=&#34;projects&#34;&gt;Projects&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;projects.yml contains the configurations of your projects. It allows you to
bind your commands, store your project configuration and generate your own
subcommands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The file content looks like the following example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-yaml&#34;&gt;    regexrace:
        deploy_cmd: bash deploy.sh
        description: Train your regex skills
        dummy_custom_cmd: this command is really simple=mongo localhost
        health: /status
        repository: thylong/regexrace
        rollback_cmd: bash rollback.sh
        url: http://regexrace.org
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;editing-yaml-files&#34;&gt;Editing yaml files&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ian configuration files can be found in &lt;code&gt;$HOME/.config/ian&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Any contribution to this project is more than welcomed ! As small or big as they are, contributions are what will make this project better. There is still a lot to do : reporting bugs, proposing fixes, new features, helping with the documentation&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it’s your first contribution, no worries. As long as you follow the guidelines, everything is going to be fine :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;open-an-issue&#34;&gt;Open an issue&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you spot a bug or want to propose an enhancement, you can open an issue on Github. Please make sure to avoid duplicates and explain clearly what is your need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;coding-guidelines&#34;&gt;Coding guidelines&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project wants to stay close to the standard and was inspired by Kubernetes CLI, Cobra and Requests code quality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My advice would be to follow effective Go guide and to listen to golinter suggestions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;creating-a-pull-request&#34;&gt;Creating a pull request&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fork the project&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install dev dependencies and package&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Checkout a new branch based on dev&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make your change and run the test suite&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be sure to respect Go conventions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run the entire test suite before commiting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If your commit fixes an open issue, reference it in the commit message&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Commit with a proper commit message&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open a PR using this description structure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Travis (CI) will run on your branch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the PR is accepted, it will be merged into the dev branch and then released.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(d) If the Work includes a &amp;ldquo;NOTICE&amp;rdquo; text file as part of its
      distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
      include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained

      documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
      within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
      wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
      of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
      do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution

  defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
  incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
  of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

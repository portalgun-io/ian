      <description>Ian is a simple tool to manage your development environment and your coding projects.
The idea behind Ian Us, developers, love to work with the terminal. More reliable and simpler than most GUIs, this &amp;ldquo;black screen&amp;rdquo; allows also automation through scripting and blazing fast manipulation.
But even with these capabilities, we still execute pretty repetitive tasks and have troubles to make our local environment portable. Sometimes, we&amp;rsquo;re looking in our history to retrieve a database URI, change from one project directory to another one just to execute a command, and so on.</description>

      <description>Ian relies a lot on configuration files as they describe your environment and your projects. It&amp;rsquo;s possible to edit your entire configuration using ian commands (recommended) but if you&amp;rsquo;re stuck or if you simply prefer to edit manually your configuration, it&amp;rsquo;s possible !
Ian configuration files are written with Yaml and are relatively simple to read. If you don&amp;rsquo;t have specific ian files, no worries some are going to be generated for you when you execute it for the first time.</description>
